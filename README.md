📌 Binary Adder Project
🚀 A simulation of a Binary Adder using Python and the 8085 microprocessor architecture.

📖 Overview
This project implements a Binary Adder using Python and simulates how an 8085 microprocessor handles binary arithmetic. It demonstrates fundamental concepts in digital arithmetic and microprocessor programming.

🔧 Features
✔ Implements Binary Addition Algorithm in Python
✔ Simulates 8085 Microprocessor Architecture
✔ Provides a Visual Representation of the computation
✔ Written in an easy-to-understand Python script

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x
A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
8085 Microprocessor knowledge (optional)
💡 How It Works
The program initializes virtual 8085 registers.
It takes two binary numbers as input.
It simulates the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to perform bitwise addition.
Flags are updated to indicate carry and overflow.
The final sum is displayed.
